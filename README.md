# UX

## User stories.

As the developer of the site I would like to make site presentable and appealing to get hired.

As the user of the site will want the site to present clear information of the developer to see if they can get hired.

As an employer would like to be able to contact the developer for opportunity.

As the developer would want to present a timeline of data to show experiences.

As the developer would like to show the projects working on and show the users where the projects can be found.

A user I would like to be able to navigate the site easily from page to page.

## Features

### Navbar
The site has a navbar to navigate pages to see the correct page displayed in the title/icon.
The navbar has responsive features on when hovering over an icon changes color to indicate to the user that is where the mouse is.
Timeline feature on two pages - Work time line and Education History
The timeline feature is a graphical display to show the history of the portfolio with dates above to give the user information about the portfolio.

### Contact form
The contact form is a HTML form where a user can fill in information into the form and click on the button for the page to trigger.
The form has validation on all fields so will tell the user the field is invalid. When the form is valid a Modal shall appear to say to user the form has been sent.
