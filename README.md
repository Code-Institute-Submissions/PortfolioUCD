# PortfolioUCD

This is a static portfolio to show the best light for myself as an upcoming developer to be hired from poteinal employers. 

UX
User stories. 

 

As  the developer of the site I would like to make site presentable and appealing to get hired. 

As the user of the site will want the site to present clear information of the developer to see if they can get hired.  

As an employer would like to be able to contact the developer for opportunity. 

As the developer would want to present a timeline of data to show experiences. 

As the developer would like to show the projects working on and show the users where the projects can be found. 

 

A  user I would like to be able to navigate the site easily from page to page.
